# Hotel_Booking_EDA
In-depth Exploration and Analysis of a Hotel Booking Dataset

Project Overview:

Importing Libraries and Loading Data:

Imported necessary libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib. Suppressed warnings for cleaner output. Loaded hotel booking dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning:

Examined the first 10 rows of the dataset using head(10). Obtained dataset information (data types, missing values) using info(). Determined dataset dimensions with shape and displayed column names with columns. Converted 'reservation_status_date' column to datetime format. Iterated over categorical columns to display unique values. Dropped 'company' and 'agent' columns using drop(). Removed rows with missing values using dropna(). Data Analysis and Visualizations:

Calculated percentage of canceled and not canceled reservations using value_counts(normalize=True). Created bar plots to visualize reservation status distribution. Used count plots to examine cancellation rates based on factors: hotel type, customer type, arrival date month. Generated line plots for Average Daily Rate (ADR) trends over time for resort and city hotels. Visualized cancellations based on ADR using line plots. Utilized pie charts to identify top 10 countries with highest numbers of canceled reservations. Analyzed reservations based on market segment using count plots. Time-Based Visualizations and Insights:

Created line plots to visualize ADR trends over time for both resort and city hotels. Applied filtering for specific time periods in ADR trend visualizations. This project encompassed loading, cleaning, and exploring a hotel booking dataset, followed by generating various visualizations to gain deeper insights into factors influencing reservation cancellations and related patterns.
